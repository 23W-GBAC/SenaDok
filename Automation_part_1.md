# First automation part
This first part will be all about how I came to a conclusion with what my topic will be and the issues I have come across as I have been reserching

I have thought about writing logs but decided to make weekly updates. This week I have decided that I wanted to pursue any topic related with Medicine, and realized I need to choose a more specific thing to research and talk about. I wanted my blog to be as research-heavy as possible, as it is something that I enjoy doing and I am good at, so mixing research and coding seems like a good idea.

....

I have then realized that just talking about the availability of doctors is still a very broad topic, so I had to be more specific about what I want to pursue.

Then hospitals were brought to my attention as I had gotten sick but had a hard time deciding where to go. So this made me realize I am not as informed as I should be about them. But then how do I include Technology in hospitals?
I decided I'll not that broad but not very specific.

....

I'm the end I decided making a list of hospitals would be a great solution. However further research showed me there is possibly too many hospitals to write about, exactly around 397 according to the governmental website by Germany providing in-depth information about hospitals. Then I decided to narrow down my research to the major cities in Bavaria and went along with the top 15 major cities that have known hospitals as well.
I have found a government website that already lists all the hospitals and even allows me to filter with the specialities that are needed for specific cases. So to make my blog more different than the rest, I will only include the top 5 major hospitals as well as details they provide. However, I still haven't decided what my automation can be for this blog and project.

In the end I have thought about it a bit more and decided to make a table as well as a search engine which will help the user to find hospitals exactly from the cities that are included. However the making of this automation will take some time to figure out.

....

I realized that many major cities don't exactly have 5 hospitals but sometimes way less. So in the end I decided it would be the best to just write down the hospitals that are within the cities borders and have enough cases to be marked as an official hospital.

I have also come to the conclusion that not all cities just have hospitals but also clinics that is just more specialized in specific things rather than how hospitals are so including them seemed as a very important decision I had to take.
