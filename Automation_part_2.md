# Second part
Firstly, verifying the authenticity of hospitals has proven to be harder than I anticipated. The internet is flooded with information, and with many options everywhere, distinguishing between real hospitals and potentially misleading sources is pretty hard since I cannot go and check each one individually. It's was very important that I know that the healthcare providers I searched are legitimate, accredited establishments. This involves cross-referencing information from multiple sources, and checking for official certifications.

And then sifting through a lot of amount of information available is overwhelming. Each hospital provides a huge amount of details ranging from services offered and medical specialities to patient reviews and facility amenities like the amounts of beds there are which is available. It's like navigating a maze where every turn leads to more options so I ended up thinking more about what I needed to do. Balancing the need for comprehensive information with the overwhelming volume of details can be a very task. In the end, it's about finding a balance between the thoroughness of my research and the practicality of decision-making, so I continued researching for hours

Another challenge with this automation project was that it is the time-consuming process of matching each hospital with the right images. Visual representation plays an important role in my blog to get a good impression, and it's essential to have accurate and good-looking images that represent each hospital accurately. However, finding high-quality and relevant images of the healthcare facilities is proving to be quite time-consuming. It requires sifting through numerous stock photos, official hospital galleries.

As I go through this process, I find myself caught between the desire for thorough research with a lot of information packed into my blog and the practical constraints of my limited time. The effort I had to put in and making sure that the hospitals and clinics I had on my list met the necessary criteria while also having a visual appeal.
