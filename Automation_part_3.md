# The third part
One especially frustuating thing has been the time-consuming process of cross-referencing hospital pictures with their official websites. My goal was to ensure that the visuals I needed on for representation are not only relevant but also up to date. Unfortunately, this task made me to reconsider the number of hospitals I can thoroughly research and add to my blog, both for my sake and the blog. Quality over quantity has become my motto for now to make sure I can stay motivated through this overall.

Discovering that some hospital websites don't function as expected, and are just broken was a great hurdle I had to deal with. Navigating through broken links or encountering unavailable pages forced me to take out more hospitals from my hospital list. I was frustrated dealing with technical roadblocks reminded me that the importance of website reliability for accurate and comprehensive healthcare information was my only standing blog and the only way I can actually do this blog

Another unexpected yet unfortunate twist I had to deal with was the presence of false images on Wikipedia. Wikipedia is known to be both reliable and unreliable at the same time, but the collaborative nature of the it means inaccuracies can slip through. When I realized this I decided adding an extra layer of verification by cross-checking to ensure everything is right was the right choice.
Lastly, I realized that there are different hospital names across different official websites. Some hospitals use abbreviations, while others include additional descriptors or even fully new names. This added complexity to the cross-referencing process because now I didn't only have to look out for images but also hospital names and make sure the descriptions and the websites were right and, demanding attention to detail to ensure accurate identification.
